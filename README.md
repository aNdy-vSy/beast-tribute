                    Beast Tribute
               a.k.a. Old School Demo 2               
          Released by Cosine Systems in 2018
              http://www.cosine.org.uk/

; Configuration      
;======================================================--->-- -

 This demo does not need installation. Just run the EXE file
 to play the demo.  However, the 'data' directory must be
 in the same location as the EXE or it will fail.
 
 It has been tested on various Windows machines and should run
 fine unless you only have a real old machine with slow
 onboard graphics. You will need DirectX installed for
 it to run.
 
 It has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 x64) and been
 confirmed to work as long as instructions at the beginning
 of the source are followed before re-compiling. Thanks to
 'StarBootics' of the PureBasic forum.
 
 There has been 1 report of it working on an iMAC using WINE.
 Your mileage may vary...

; Information      
;======================================================--->-- -

 This is  simple demo, expanding on learning done in 'Old
 School Demo 1'.  It was produced in response to the various
 Psygnosis tribute demos that appeared on the 'Dark Bit
 Factory & Gravity' Purebasic forum during 2018.
 
 Various animation routines will find their way into
 a game, soon to be released by Cosine!

 The source is provided as a learning tool for others and,
 yes, some bits could be reduced in size using loops, etc.,
 but since this is for beginners to follow also, it
 has been coded and commented to be as readable and 
 friendly as possible.  It should be found in the 'source'
 folder.
 
 It is common for PureBasic resources to be comverted to
 data and included in the compiled EXE.  However, in this
 case, all of the graphics are provided in their original
 bitmap format so you can see how they all slot together
 and how they are used.
 
;================================================--->-- -
; Extras    
;======================================================--->-- -

 There should be an 'extras' folder included in the
 download. This folder contains a few files not directly
 used by the demo, but you may find interesting.
 
 The music is in OGG format when loaded in the demo, but the
 original MOD that was written especially for this demo is
 included so you can see how that was done too. It
 was written in OpenMPT, but should load into any tracker
 that supports MOD format.  The samples were ripped from
 Shadow of the Beast using WinUAE, so credit must be
 given to David Whittaker, who wrote the original music.
 
 The orginal version of the Aarbron render by Hyb1rd-1982
 is included, so you can see what it looked like before it
 was reduced in size and desaturated for the demo intro.
 
 Finally, there is a screen dump of the original SotB
 game screen and one of the demo screen so you can do a
 comparison of old and new.

 Special thanks to KrazyK (DBF Forum) for pointers on the
 animation and Hyb1rd-1982 (DeviantArt) for permission to
 use the Aarbron render that appears in grey scale in the
 intro to the main screen.
 
 Thanks to StarBootics (PureBasic Forum) for testing
 under Linux and suggesting a minor change so it
 will compile successfully.
 
 Thanks also to the usual suspects, T.M.R/Cosine,
 Moloch/Triad and Warlock/Arkanix Labs for testing,
 comments and suggestions.
